# BankingCustomerChurnPrediction
**Abstract**
A major concern of the bank is preventing customer churn to avoid revenue loss and build customer loyalty. The present research involves the use of ML techniques in Azure ML Studio to establish a Logistic Regression model for predicting if a customer will leave the bank based on important financial and behavioral predictors. It involved preprocessing data including handling of missing values, categorical encoding, and feature selection. The logistic regression model gave an accuracy of 81.05%, showing its efficiency in identifying customers that might leave. The problem of data imbalance affected the recall of churned customers. This shows a need for further improvement in the recent developments of the model. The results provide value for customers to carry out appropriate retention strategies in the banks to prevent customer defection.

**Introduction**
Churn within banking remains a major significant concern which leads to the loss of clients reduces revenue and increases a bank's cost of replacing those same clients. Conventional approaches to detecting churn were reactive; they happened after a customer harvested his leaves. With machine learning, the banks could now predict churn before it occurred, thus enabling intervention before the customer quits. In this research, we proposed an ML model for predicting churn developed in Azure ML Studio, with the goal of identifying vulnerable clients. Such dataset includes customers' demographics, financial transactions, and banking engagement activity, after analysis which will depict factors fuelling churn tendencies. The main focus aimed to develop a predictive model that is effective as a tool that would reduce customer attrition in banks like, for instance, through facilitating decision-making grounded on data. 

**Literature Review**
Various studies have sought to apply machine learning techniques in predicting bank customer churn while encouraging proactive retention efforts. Drivers of churn articulated by Dpapcodes (2022) include dissatisfaction with service quality and low engagement, and Datrics AI (2022) showed that logistic regression and decision trees could enhance churn prediction accuracy. Peng et al. (2023) proposed an optimized version of the XGBoost model, which did attain substantial predictive performance, yet was not interpretable for a business setting. 
Tran and Nguyen (2023) stated that customer segmentation accentuates churn detection, however real-time deployment is the hurdle. Kmalit (2023) compared deep learning and classical methods of machine learning, stating that neural networks indeed improve accuracy, though they lack explainability. Brito, Silva, and Garcia (2024) put special emphasis on the contribution of feature selection in predicting churn; in their view, financial behavior is the pivotal indicator. Such studies offer suggestions in a retrospective manner rather than an all-real-time execution, leaving a very pertinent gap in future applied studies within the practical field of banking. It is an ambition of this research to bridge this gap by training for and developing an interpretable logistic regression model on Azure ML Studio, with a view to examining the key customer engagement factors in the prediction of churn, to guide decision-making regarding improved retention strategies.

**Methodology****
The problem definition targeted the prediction of customer churn primarily from behavioral and financial perspectives. Data acquired from Kaggle contained details about customers, including credit score, age, balance, number of banking products, and activity in accounts. The preprocessing steps included the treatment of missing values and categorical encoding as well as some feature selection to give clean and structured data. 
Selection of the model-for study was Logistic Regression, a simple yet powerful algorithm for classification problems. The data was divided into training and testing sets. A training set comprised 80% of the total data, while the other 20% comprised the test set, with the model trained on key predictive features. The data was normalized by Standard scaler to enhance the performance of the model.
Challenges faced were dataset access & preprocessing: Importing the dataset in Azure ML Studio and dealing with issues posed by missing values needed multiple iterations preceding the point of clean data. Feature Engineering: Finding the most relevant features, and categorical values were major domains, with correct encoding being very vital. Model Deployment Issues: Storage of the trained model and its access kept showing difficulties in Azure ML Studio, indicating alternative evaluations.

**Results:**
The Logistic Regression tested out to be 81.05% accurate, indicating that it often correctly predicts customer churn. However, when delving deeper into the classification report, the recall for churners was found to be very low (15%), which meant many actual churners were misclassified. This is a commonly faced problem in imbalanced datasets, where the majority class (non-churners) outweighs predictions.

**Conclusion**
Speciation of ML-based customer churn prediction models was performed using Logistic Regression in Microsoft Azure ML Studio. The outcome of the model provided valuable insights into the behavioral patterns of churn. The results of the model could enable banks to take preventive steps to avoid customer churn. While it performed satisfactorily, the greater concern of the model lies with its low recall for churners, needing support in some areas such as class balance, either via different models such as ensemble models or better feature engineering methods.
From a business point of view, the prediction of a churn before it transpires allows banks to minimize their attrition rate by optimizing retention efforts and enjoying better relations with customers. Future work should focus on proactively improving performance of the model, incorporation of real-time customer data and probably other advanced AI techniques to fairly improve churn predictions. This study marks a leap toward an establishment of a data-driven vision of a customer retention strategy in banking, which would allow banks to block a leak by improving profitability and customer satisfaction in a long run.
