**Banking Customer Churn Prediction: Leveraging Microsoft Azure ML to retain customers**
**Abstract**
Customer Churn is one of the major challenges in the banking industry, which affects revenue and customer engagement with the bank. This paper studies the application of logistic regression, a machine learning model using Microsoft Azure to predict banking customer churn prediction which ensures banks take proactive measures to retain customers timely. The study has used a dataset which includes customersâ€™ demographics, transaction history and their engagement with the bank and I have preprocessed and developed a predictive model. Additionally, I have tested various hypotheses to understand the relationship between customer attributes and churn probability which included studying whether lower account balance, decreased transaction frequency, and reduced engagement with banking services significantly contribute to the customer churn. The findings from the model suggested that my ML prediction model can provide some insight regarding the customer which can be used for improving customer engagement and retention strategies. I feel this research could be very useful for financial services or banks which can use artificial intelligence for customer churn prediction.
