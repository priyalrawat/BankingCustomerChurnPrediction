# BankingCustomerChurnPrediction
**Introduction**
Churn within banking remains a major significant concern which leads to the loss of clients reduces revenue and increases a bank's cost of replacing those same clients. Conventional approaches to detecting churn were reactive; they happened after a customer harvested his leaves. With machine learning, the banks could now predict churn before it occurred, thus enabling intervention before the customer quits. 
In this research, we proposed an ML model for predicting churn developed in Azure ML Studio, with the goal of identifying vulnerable clients. Such dataset includes customers' demographics, financial transactions, and banking engagement activity, after analysis which will depict factors fuelling churn tendencies. The main focus aimed to develop a predictive model that is effective as a tool that would reduce customer attrition in banks like, for instance, through facilitating decision-making grounded on data.
